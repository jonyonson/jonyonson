### Hi, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a role as a full stack or front-end developer where I can solve interesting problems and continue to grow as a developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and recently converted [Snapstock's front-end](https://github.com/jonyonson/snapstock-fe) to TypeScript. I need to narrow some types, but I am definitely seeing an improved development experience with less errors.
